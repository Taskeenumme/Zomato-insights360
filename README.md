🍽️ Zomato Data Analysis Project

1. 📘 Project Overview

This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Zomato restaurant data to uncover insights into restaurant trends, customer preferences, pricing, and ratings. Using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment, the analysis explores relationships among cuisines, cost, location, ratings, and other attributes to better understand the dynamics of the restaurant industry.

 2. 💡 Objectives

* Analyze restaurant distribution across cities and cuisines.
* Identify factors influencing restaurant ratings and costs.
* Explore correlations between online delivery options, votes, and ratings.
* Visualize data trends using powerful Python visualization libraries.
